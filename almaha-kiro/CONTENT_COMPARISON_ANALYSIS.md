## 🚨 **Critical Issue Summary**

**The current React pages contain generic placeholder content instead of the actual Al Maha Foods content from the original HTML pages.**

This means:
- ❌ **Content accuracy is compromised**
- ❌ **Brand messaging is incorrect**
- ❌ **Key business information is missing**
- ❌ **Important links and resources are absent**
- ❌ **Visual parity cannot be achieved without correct content**

## 📝 **Recommendation**

**STOP styling guide implementation and FIRST fix content accuracy:**

1. **Phase 1:** Extract and implement correct content from HTML pages
2. **Phase 2:** Ensure all images, links, and resources are properly referenced
3. **Phase 3:** Verify content placement matches original layout
4. **Phase 4:** THEN proceed with styling guide implementation

**Content accuracy must come before visual styling to ensure the React application properly represents Al Maha Foods' actual business information and messaging.**
