# Homepage Layout and Content Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ❌ PREVIOUS PROBLEMS
The React homepage had completely wrong content and layout compared to the WordPress original:

2. **Wrong Slider Content**: Had placeholder content instead of actual WordPress slide text
3. **Missing WordPress Sections**: Lacked "Welcome to Al Maha Foods" and "Vision" sections
4. **Wrong Layout**: Used generic feature cards instead of WordPress-specific layout
