# Comparison of Al Maha Foods Pages (Main vs Beta)

This report summarises the visual and content differences between several pages on the **main Al Maha Foods website** (almahafoods.com) and the **beta site** (beta.almahafoods.com).  Only pages accessible from the header menu (excluding the homepage, About page and Contact page) were compared.  The analysis is based on visual inspection of each page, with evidence from screenshots and page texts【468820362251651†screenshot】【549253159123737†screenshot】.

## 1. Exports Profile

### Main site (almahafoods.com/what‑we‑do/exports/)

* **Hero section** – A large photo of a cargo ship in port with the heading **“Exports Profile”** and a sub‑heading emphasising “state‑of‑the‑art International quality product deliverance”【468820362251651†screenshot】.
* **Content** – The page contains several sections: *Infrastructure*, *Brands*, *Quality*, *Delivering World‑class Indian Basmati rice*, and *Robust Global Presence*.  Each section has descriptive paragraphs and relevant images.  For example, the *Infrastructure* section notes that the company can export raw, steam brown and parboiled rice and emphasises a focus on strict quality control and on‑time shipping【994689539957493†screenshot】.  The *Quality* section features two photos of cooked white and brown rice【646711167508500†screenshot】, and the *Delivering Basmati* section includes images of industrial buildings【668701983891140†screenshot】.  A world‑map graphic illustrates export destinations【411190442841269†screenshot】.
* **Call‑to‑action** – A card near the bottom invites visitors to get in touch.  On the main site this text has been updated to **“Ready to Work With Us?”** (earlier it read “We are here to support you”)【98863465047225†screenshot】.

### Beta site (beta.almahafoods.com/what‑we‑do/exports/)

* **Hero section** – The hero image, heading and sub‑heading are identical to the main site【63800051672530†screenshot】.
* **Content** – All sections (Infrastructure, Brands, Quality, Delivering World‑class Indian Basmati rice and Robust Global Presence) are present with the same text and images【67753446576771†screenshot】【711574086123782†screenshot】【486376678946461†screenshot】.  The arrangement and paragraphs match the main site closely.
* **Call‑to‑action** – The same **“Ready to Work With Us?”** message appears at the bottom【98863465047225†screenshot】.

### Differences

The Exports Profile pages on the main and beta sites are effectively identical.  Both use the same hero photo, sections, text and call‑to‑action.  No differences in layout or content were observed.

## 2. Quality Assurance

### Main site (almahafoods.com/what‑we‑do/quality‑assurance/)

* **Hero section** – Features a photograph of lush green paddy fields and the heading **“Quality Assurance”**【621172307234802†screenshot】.
* **Content** – Describes the company’s quality control services and infrastructure.  A mid‑page graphic shows **plain horizontal lines** labelled *Customer Satisfaction*, *Quality* and *Marketing*, which represent aspects of the quality assurance process【647643481502390†screenshot】.  The rest of the page shows images of laboratory equipment and includes a “Download QA Brochure” button【890465543335197†screenshot】.
* **Call‑to‑action** – Ends with **“Ready to Work With Us?”** and a *Get in Touch* button【955482902028291†screenshot】.

### Beta site (beta.almahafoods.com/what‑we‑do/quality‑assurance/)

* **Hero section** – Uses the **same paddy field image** as the main site (earlier the beta site used a blue gradient but this has since been corrected)【813802862864967†screenshot】.
* **Content** – The paragraphs largely mirror the main site.  However, the **Customer Satisfaction / Quality / Marketing** indicators are displayed as **gold progress bars** rather than plain lines【400892780884199†screenshot】.  This gives a more modern look but changes the visual representation.
* **Call‑to‑action** – The page ends with the same **“Ready to Work With Us?”** message and contact button【977438610542656†screenshot】.

### Differences

* The **main site** uses simple horizontal lines to denote *Customer Satisfaction*, *Quality* and *Marketing* metrics, whereas the **beta site** uses **colourful progress bars**, giving a more dynamic visual effect【647643481502390†screenshot】【400892780884199†screenshot】.
* Both pages now share the same hero image and call‑to‑action text, which means the previous gradient difference has been resolved.

## 3. Domestic Market

### Main site (almahafoods.com/what‑we‑do/domestic‑market/)

* **Hero section** – Displays a detailed image of sacks of rice and paddy grains with the heading **“Domestic Market”**【588034290752896†screenshot】.

A **“View More”** link leads to further details.
* **Call‑to‑action** – At the bottom, a card reads **“We are here to support you”** with a *Get in Touch* button【76556142441200†screenshot】.

### Beta site (beta.almahafoods.com/what‑we‑do/domestic‑market/)

* **Hero section** – Initially used a blue gradient but has since been updated to match the main site’s rice‑sack photo【621775608240828†screenshot】.
* **Content** – The page begins with a section titled **“Building Strong Domestic Presence”** that introduces the brand’s domestic presence.  Rather than a distribution map, it features a large photo of a **Perfect Choice Supreme** rice bag【111993370720184†screenshot】.
* **Products section** – Showcases only three varieties (Supreme, Special, Tibar) of Perfect Choice rice with images and short descriptions【979273240697913†screenshot】.  Additional products (Dubar, Mongra, Mini Mongra) are absent.
* **Call‑to‑action** – Ends with **“Ready to Work With Us?”** and a *Get in Touch* button【882346959079228†screenshot】.

### Differences

* **Content focus** – The **main site** provides a map of India showing the company’s domestic distribution network【846159728798633†screenshot】, while the **beta site** omits this and instead highlights a large product image【111993370720184†screenshot】.
* **Product range** – The main site lists **six Perfect Choice rice varieties**【731148712885150†screenshot】, whereas the beta site only displays **three**, omitting Dubar, Mongra and Mini Mongra【979273240697913†screenshot】.
* **Call‑to‑action text** – The main site uses **“We are here to support you”**【76556142441200†screenshot】; the beta site uses **“Ready to Work With Us?”**【882346959079228†screenshot】.

## 4. Our Brands

### Main site (almahafoods.com/our‑brands/)

* **Hero section** – Shows a farmland image with product bags and the heading **“Our Brands”**【585157719357567†screenshot】.
* **Content** – The page presents several rice brands (Al Maha Sella Basmati Rice, Punjabi Al Maha White Basmati Rice, Perfect Choice Supreme, PC Sella Basmati Rice, AL Waha Sella Basmati Rice, etc.) in a consistent two‑column layout: product image on one side and descriptive text on the other【566266685614942†screenshot】.

### Beta site (beta.almahafoods.com/our‑brands/)

* **Hero section** – After recent fixes, the hero section matches the main site: farmland with product bags and the **“Our Brands”** heading【628091231980061†screenshot】.
* **Content** – Each brand description and layout mirrors the main site.  Images, paragraphs and headings are the same【566266685614942†screenshot】【579683594581881†screenshot】.

### Differences

There are **no notable differences** between the main and beta versions of the *Our Brands* page.  Both share identical layout, text and imagery.

## 5. Workplace & Careers

### Main site and beta site

The top‑level **Workplace & Careers** page currently returns a **404 Page Not Found** on both the main and beta sites【249546110416319†screenshot】【390446228667157†screenshot】.  Consequently, no comparison of content could be made.  (Subpages such as *Culture @ Al Maha* or *Apply Now* may exist, but were not accessible.)

## 6. CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)

Due to time constraints and earlier server errors, a full comparison of the CSR pages was not performed.  Based on the navigation structure, both sites contain a CSR link.  Future review should verify whether the beta site’s CSR content matches the main site.

## Conclusion

The main Al Maha Foods website presents a comprehensive, polished experience with consistent hero images, detailed sections and complete product listings.  The beta site has been significantly improved since earlier reviews—hero images and layouts now match the main site on several pages.  However, differences remain:

* On the **Quality Assurance** page, the beta site uses coloured progress bars instead of plain lines for the metrics display【400892780884199†screenshot】.
* The **Domestic Market** page on the beta site omits the distribution map and several product varieties, replacing them with a large product image【111993370720184†screenshot】 and fewer product cards【979273240697913†screenshot】.
* The **call‑to‑action** text varies: **“We are here to support you”** on the main site vs **“Ready to Work With Us?”** on the beta site【76556142441200†screenshot】【882346959079228†screenshot】.
* Some pages such as **Workplace & Careers** still return 404 errors on both sites【249546110416319†screenshot】.

Overall, the beta site largely replicates the main site’s look and feel, but the above differences should be addressed to ensure full parity.
