# üìù Al Maha Foods React Conversion ‚Äì Session Snapshot (YYYY-MM-DD)

## 1. Active Dev Server
‚Ä¢ Running command: `npm run dev` in project root (I:\work\almaha)  
‚Ä¢ Terminal ID: 3‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Command ID: `5be3dcce-4ef9-4b98-9b2c-5b88883dfe20`  
‚Ä¢ Local preview URL: **http://localhost:3000/exports** (auto-reloads with Vite)

## 2. Latest Code Changes
1. **Exports.jsx**
   ‚Ä¢ Removed stray `javascript` token on line 1 that caused `ReferenceError: javascript is not defined`.  
   ‚Ä¢ File now begins with `import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';`.

2. **Robust Global Presence section added earlier**
   ‚Ä¢ Added world-map visualization (amCharts) and accompanying JSX/CSS.  
   ‚Ä¢ CSS updates in `Exports.module.css`.

## 3. Outstanding Visual / Content Tasks
1. Audit Exports page for:
   - Any remaining incorrect/missing text.
   - Missing or incorrect images (aside from hero).
2. Verify new ‚ÄúRobust Global Presence‚Äù section:
   - Sidebar heading present.
   - Descriptive paragraph + interactive map visible.
   - Spacing (72 px rule) consistent with design.
3. Repeat text/image audit & fixes for:
   - About page
   - Quality Assurance page
   - Domestic Market page
4. Global styling clean-up:
   - Button + heading consistency
   - Spacing / alignment across audited pages

## 4. Assets / Components Referenced
‚Ä¢ World map code reused from `src/components/home/InternationalPresence.jsx`  
‚Ä¢ Images referenced in `/public/assets/images/exports/` (rice_field.jpg, basmtrice.jpg, etc.)

## 5. Key File Paths
```
src/pages/Exports.jsx
src/pages/Exports.module.css
src/components/common/StickySidebar.jsx
public/assets/images/exports/...
```

## 6. How to Resume
1. Re-open terminal (or re-run `npm run dev`) if server isn‚Äôt running.  
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/exports` to verify pages.  
3. Continue audits / fixes as per task list.  
4. Ping me with this snapshot; I‚Äôll continue from the same state.
