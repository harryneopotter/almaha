1. Go to **http://localhost:3000**
2. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. Scroll through the entire page

- [ ] White header text over slider
- [ ] News section (below maps)
- [ ] Business section (below news)
- [ ] Featured article with magazine image (below business)

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Images Downloaded:
All missing hero slider images were downloaded from the live WordPress site and saved to `public/assets/images/home/`.

### amCharts Configuration:
The maps are now properly configured to:
- Hide the amCharts watermark/logo
- Display clean, interactive maps
- Highlight appropriate regions in red (#fe0000)

### Content Sections:
All three new sections (News, Business, Featured Article) use the exact same:
- Headlines
- Dates  
- Descriptions
- Link URLs

from the live WordPress site.

---

## ⚠️ Known Remaining Differences

### Footer Credits:
The local site shows:
- "Designed & Developed By Cyberworx"

This is **intentional** and was in the original design specifications.

### Downloadable Documents:
Links point to `/assets/documents/Privacy-Policy-Al-maha.pdf`

You'll need to:
1. Create `public/assets/documents/` folder
2. Add the PDF file there

### Article Links:
Currently, article links point to paths like:
- `/indian-basmati-rice-market-update-august-2025/`
- `/from-strategy-to-success-the-journey-of-a-visionary-ceo-business-connect/`

These pages need to be created separately when you're ready to convert those pages.
