Here’s a detailed comparison of the two webpages—**https://www.almahafoods.com/** (Live site) and **http://localhost:3000/** (Local development copy)—highlighting their visual and content differences based on the extracted page content:

### **Similarities**

- Both sites have the same core sections:
    - Main navigation menu (Home, About Us, What We Do, Our Brands, CSR, Workplace \& Careers, Contact Us).
    - Prominent “Al Maha Foods” branding and similar slogan.
    - Sections for Quality, Customer Satisfaction, Leadership, International Presence, Domestic Presence.
    - "Contact Us" with matching address, phone, and email details.
    - Both sites feature social media icons in the footer.
    - Navigation structure and main call-to-actions (like "Get In Touch") are aligned.


### **Key Visual \& Content Differences**

| Aspect | Live Site (https://www.almahafoods.com/) | Local Site (http://localhost:3000/) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Banner Images** | Multiple hero/slider images for visual engagement | "Al Maha Foods Logo" text, unclear if images are loading or missing |
| **About/Welcome** | Detailed about/welcome text | Slightly reworded or restructured text |
| **Certification Section** | NABL, ISO, Star Export House certifications explicitly mentioned | Summary mention; less emphasis |
| **News Section** | “News” section with market updates and business stories | No explicit news section visible |
| **Charts/Maps** | Contains world and India map for international/domestic reach, using zoom | Charts rendered using amCharts (“Chart created using amCharts...”) |
| **Read More Links** | Links to “Business Connect” articles and market updates | Lacks these highlight/news links |
| **Footer Credits** | “© 2003-2024 Al Maha Foods. All rights reserved” | Adds “Designed \& Developed By Cyberworx”, credits, updated year |
| **Downloadable Docs** | Links actual PDFs/documents | Points to different file paths (/assets/documents/...) |
| **Brand Imagery** | Multiple headings with inline images (rice bags, slides, etc.) | Only "Al Maha Foods Logo" mentioned, with possible image omission |
| **Content Details** | Some richer text, testimonials, and engaging descriptions | Slightly condensed/edited content and action-oriented prompts |
| **Contact Links** | Uses “mailto” and “tel” HTML schemes for contact actions | Same, and more explicit tel/mailto links observed |

### **Notable Visual Difference Examples**

- **Maps/Charts:** On the local site, placeholders like “Chart created using amCharts library” appear, suggesting chart rendering issues or dev-mode text. The live site presents actual interactive maps of the world and India.
- **Images and Slides:** The live site loads multiple product/about images (with actual filenames); the local site refers to images (e.g., "Al Maha Foods Logo") but it’s not clear if the images render.
- **Footer \& Copyright:** “Designed \& Developed By Cyberworx” only appears on the local site.
- **News Section:** Market updates and business articles only appear on the live site.

***

### **Summary**

- **If both pages are meant to be 100% visually identical, current differences suggest issues with:**
    - Image rendering or linking (local missing images or asset paths).
    - Chart rendering on local (development library text appearing).
    - News, business, and certification details not ported or partially missing on local.
    - Credits and design attributions in the local version’s footer.

**These discrepancies indicate that the local version is either using development placeholders, missing certain dynamic/asset loads, or has not been fully synced with the live content and resources**.[^1][^2]
